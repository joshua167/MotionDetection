## Instruction
Make sure the local device has a web camera or a similar camera. Download MotionDetection.py and run it through any local IDE or editor that has the OpenCV package installed. If the OpenCV package is not installed in the IDE or editor, it must be installed for this program to work. For PyCharm, simply click on the error indicator in the first line of the program, then click on the red light bulb and choose “Install package cv2”. Once OpenCV is installed, run the program.
